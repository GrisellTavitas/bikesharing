**Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.**
Having the opportunity to present the Bikesharing project to an investor, it is as good as that is a rare occurrence, indeed that is the main objective for searching efective tools of visualization for our analysis; so once it occurs we expect to have the proper way to share the key points of our analysis and finally to convince to the investors

**Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.**
After going into some trends in NYC's behaviour related to this business, we can tell that: 

![General Details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90433064/147484914-3039c4cb-503c-4031-894e-4bc53ddd7e92.png)

It seems that there is an explicit relation between the most popular locations on the city and the most popular starting locations for trips of bikesharing. 
We could notice as well, that the peak hours of use for the bikes are placed between the 17 and 19 hours, ocurring during these hours the 20% of the total number of trips; so we have to be aware of having the enough bikes on those popular places to be able to supply all the rides needed.  

![Details per customer 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90433064/147487821-6202b448-d21d-4c1d-8ef8-22168b9a2fd3.png)

Regarding the duration of the trip related to the customers in general, or analized by gender, we can say that while the curve of female users it keeps estable over the number of rides, even though between them it could appears a variance on the duration of those trips. On the other hand, we can see a peak on the number of rides and at the same time we can recognize a trend on the duration of the trips that are around over the 5 minutes, and after that duration the number of rides goes down critically.
Talking in general terms, the tendency is marked by the male users, since they represent the mayority on the customer gender.

![Details per customer 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90433064/147489257-0579a812-334a-47fa-ae32-b61e081b2532.png)

Here is an important detailed analysis over the weekdays and the hours on those, when the customers use more frecquently the bikesharing service. And beyond that we can see that same analysis separately by gender needs.

In the last visualization we can notice that the clients that use the service the most, are subscribers and mainly males. In the heatmap we can notice that thursday is the most popular day on the week for the bikesharing service for this mentioned target.  

**Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.**

After all this previous analysis, we can see that there is a lot of opportunities to have a succesfull business with the bikesharing service. Nevertheless, we have to bear in mind that we shouldn't probably contemplate the same portion of users from the tourist market, since we know that NYC has a big advantage in that area during the whole year, versus the business market where Des Moines has been declared as the Best Place for Business from 2010. 

Another thing that we should consider is the change on the transportation needs because the different seasons, since we just analized August as one of the primary months for this service in NYC, but we should contemplate as well the other side of the coin when probably the extreme weather wouldn't help to promote this service. So in that case, we should analize the needs for this season as well, maintenience for the bikes, less use on the service, etc. All the previous details are needed to make the real anual budget of the business.
