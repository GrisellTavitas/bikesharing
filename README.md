It seems that there is an explicit relation between the most popular locations on the city and the most popular starting locations for trips of bikesharing. 
We could notice as well, that the peak hours of use for the bikes are placed between the 17 and 19 hours, ocurring during these hours the 20% of the total number of trips; so we have to be aware of having the enough bikes on those popular places to be able to supply all the rides needed.

Regarding the duration of the trip related to the customers in general, or analized by gender, we can say that while the curve of female users it keeps estable over the number of rides, even though between them it could appears a variance on the duration of those trips. On the other hand, we can see a peak on the number of rides and at the same time we can recognize a trend on the duration of the trips that are around over the 5 minutes, and after that duration the number of rides goes down critically.
Talking in general terms, the tendency is marked by the male users, since they represent the mayority on the customer gender.
